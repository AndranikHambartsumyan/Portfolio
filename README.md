About me

Detail-oriented Manual QA Tester with a strong  foundation in software testing principles, bug tracking, and test case development. I quickly 
learn new tools and technologies, with hands-on experience in writing test scenarios, executing 
test cases, and reporting defects.  I also have extensive gaming experience, having 
played dozens of different games—ranging from casual to competitive, including mobile, console, 
and PC projects. This experience has helped me develop a deep understanding of user 
experience, attention to detail, and critical thinking, which is especially valuable in the QA field.
