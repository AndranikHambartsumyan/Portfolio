About me

Detail-oriented Manual QA Tester with a strong  foundation in software testing principles, bug tracking, and test case development. I quickly 
learn new tools and technologies, with hands-on experience in writing test scenarios, executing 
test cases, and reporting defects.  I also have extensive gaming experience, having 
played dozens of different games—ranging from casual to competitive, including mobile, console, 
and PC projects. This experience has helped me develop a deep understanding of user 
experience, attention to detail, and critical thinking, which is especially valuable in the QA field.

# My experience 📈

I began my QA journey on crowdtesting platforms such as test.io and uTest, where I gained hands-on experience identifying bugs across various websites and applications.
Later, I worked remotely as a Manual QA Tester at SIOY Tech for about a year, where I was responsible for end-to-end functional testing, bug reporting, and usability checks.
Additionally, I completed an internship at SCEON, where I further developed my skills in manual testing, API testing using Postman, and participated in backend test automation based on existing GraphQL scripts
